Sorry, there isn't a configure script for jitify-core yet.

There are two targets you can build from jitify-core:
  1. Jitify Tools, the command-line application
  2. Jitify for Apache, the module for Apache 2.2

To build Jitify Tools:
  1. cd to the root of the jitify-core source distribution
  2. make tools
  3. The Jitify Tools executable is now at build/jitify
  4. cp build/jitify /wherever/you/want/to/put/it

To build Jitify for Apache:
  1. cd to the root of the jitify-core source distribution
  2. Open the Makefile in your text editor of choice, and
     CHANGE the APACHE_HOME declaration at the top to point
     to the base directory of your Apache installation.  The
     Makefile looks for Apache's apxs build tool under
     $APACHE_HOME/bin
  3. make apache
  4. The Jitify for Apache dynamically loadable module is
     now at build/mod_jitify.so
  5. cp build/mod_jitify.so /wherever-your-apache-installation-is/modules
  6. Add these line to your Apache httpd.conf:
       LoadModule jitify_module modules/mod_jitify.so
       <IfModule jitify_module>
         # Enable the minification transform
         Minify On
       </IfModule>
  7. Restart Apache
