Sorry, there isn't a configure script for jitify-core yet.

There are three targets you can build from jitify-core:
  1. Jitify Tools, the command-line application
  2. Jitify for Apache, the module for Apache 2.2
  3. Jitify for nginx, the module for nginx-1.0

To build Jitify Tools:
  1. cd to the root of the jitify-core source distribution
  2. make tools
  3. The Jitify Tools executable is now at build/jitify
  4. cp build/jitify /wherever/you/want/to/put/it

To build Jitify for Apache:
  1. cd to the root of the jitify-core source distribution
  2. Open the Makefile in your text editor of choice, and
     CHANGE the APACHE_HOME declaration at the top to point
     to the base directory of your Apache installation.  The
     Makefile looks for Apache's apxs build tool under
     $APACHE_HOME/bin
  3. make apache
  4. The Jitify for Apache dynamically loadable module is
     now at build/mod_jitify.so
  5. cp build/mod_jitify.so /wherever-your-apache-installation-is/modules
  6. Add these lines to your Apache httpd.conf:
       LoadModule jitify_module modules/mod_jitify.so
       <IfModule jitify_module>
         # Enable the minification transform
         Minify On
       </IfModule>
  7. Restart Apache

To build Jitify for nginx:
  1. If you don't already the source code for nginx 1.0.x
     download and unpack it.
  2. In your nginx-1.0.x source directory, run the configure script:
       CFLAGS="-O3 -g" ./configure \
         --prefix=/directory/where/you/want/to/install/nginx \
         --add-module=/dir/containing/jitify-core/jitify-core-version/src/nginx \
         any additional nginx config options you need...
     The setting of those CFLAGS arguments is optional. "-O3" enables
     a relatively thorough level of optimization in the compiler,
     and "-g" adds debugging metadata to make the resulting nginx
     program easier to troubleshoot with gdb.
  3. Still within the nginx-1.0.x source directory,
       make
       sudo make install
  4. Edit your nginx.conf to add these lines inside the "http { ... }" block:
       minify on;
  5. Restart nginx.
